## To do list :

input -> 23 July 2016
1. Product in Processing_v0.R
- why there are some monthlies and two-weeklies products in final preprocessing
- found colours are actually monthlies products - still include as number of transactions are not big
- atm, treat monthlies, two-weeklies products as others

2. Variables related days -> 23 July 2016 (featurize_v0 both user global feature or item global feature)
- think a way to normalize (log, hyperpoblic sin transformation, box-cox)

3. Need to think about purchase data <> cold start or warm start scenarios

4. Need to find statistical evidences of days lapsed between one purchase to another -> to determine testing period

5. Look back again at featurize
- 1. How do they generate testing data (transition from training data and test data)
- 2. How prediction works ? -prediciting future products or what?
- 3. Test Coupons / Split between purchased products or test purchased products?
