#### EXPERIMENT Step by Step
made at: 26 July
file produces : modeling.R, featurize_v0

- get data of user item interactions in certain period(e.g 3 months)
- store the user interaction features in that period

create user item pairs
- get all pairs of user and item (pairs)
_ delete the duplicates

create random sampling of producst to balance the training set
- random sampling viewers

- check whether target 1 has all the features
- check target 0 : corresponding features exist or not (get theirs from product & user table)

## note on results :
- sampling is set at k = 4
- data0 is attached to feat item and feat users
- data0 features is attached to feat item, feat users, and feat user dependent (trans)
- give proportion around 40% (positive) / 60% (negative)
- best result (eta=0.05, subsample=0.6, colsample=0.2,
depth=1/2) is overfitting after epoch 6
